In my puzzle game, the background picture is in dark color. So all the lines & words are in white to jump out from the background picture. If all you see is white on the screen. Don't panic! Check background2.gif in Resources :)

For the coding strategy, I wrote the two primary classes. Class start_game is used to save user input data (player’s name, goal steps, etc.). Class game_time executes the process of the puzzle game (create and update dictionary and list, decide the win condition, and so on).

Because of unknown reasons, sometimes the turtle object’s clear function is not working. So I use the hideturtle() instead, which might lead to slow running speed. Hence clicking at a reasonable rate is highly recommended.
